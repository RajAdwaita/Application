## Inspiration üí°
This application will enable an individual to book their hotels comfortably as per their needs and requirements, for as long as they want and also for a reasonable price, as listed by the owner of the residence.
An individual may also set up his property for listing so that others may view and book it.

## What it does ‚öôÔ∏è
This application, lets you book a hotel or residence where you wish to stay, for a selected duration, and a price as listed by the owner.
The location can be anywhere in the world.
A user may set up his residence for rent.
If someone books your residence, it will display the bookings, and the owner may also delete the listing as per his choice.

## How we built it ‚öíÔ∏è
Build using typescript, mongoDB, Prisma.

## Challenges we ran into ‚ùå
Setting up the Prisma DB and connecting it to MongoDB for backend functionality, was a bit tough and I am still yet to host the wntire application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòä
The whole application is running smoothly on localhost.

## What we learned üë®‚Äçüî¨
Using PrismaDB using CLI to set up the backend for this project.


## What's next for Studious ‚è≠Ô∏è
Hosting the application and making it ready for users.
